    <p>
        Spycam is a <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bot built using my own <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J"> open source wrapper</a> of Riot Games' REST API to synthesize data from <a href="https://playvalorant.com">VALORANT</a> (a competitive first person shooter).
        For example, Spycam can send a notification in a text channel when a user completes a match, or help them track their current win-streak.
        Spycam uses OAuth to authenticate with user's Riot Accounts and the backend runs on Google Cloud managed with Docker. Monitoring is done with self-hosted Grafana, Prometheus and Loki.

        As the sole person behind this project I have prototyped the product, pitched/communicated with Riot Games for production API access, designed the server backend, implemented all code.
