    <h3>Spycam <a href="https://spycambot.net">[website]</a></h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        Spycam is a <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bot built using my own <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J"> open source wrapper</a> of Riot Games' REST API to synthesize data from <a href="https://playvalorant.com">VALORANT</a> (a competitive first person shooter).
        For example, Spycam can send a notification in a text channel when a user completes a match, or help them track their current win-streak.
        Spycam uses OAuth to authenticate with user's Riot Accounts and the backend runs on Google Cloud managed with Docker. Monitoring is done with self-hosted Grafana, Prometheus and Loki.

        As the sole person behind this project I have prototyped the product, pitched/communicated with Riot Games for production API access, designed the server backend, implemented all code.

    <h3>Chess3</h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        Chess3 is an original networked multiplayer turn-based strategy game built in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> with C#.
        Chess3 is a collaborative effort that is seeing active development.
        I manage the project and serve as our lead engineer.
        The project is organized on a private Github repository and we use issues/branches extensively to manage the concurrent work of four contributors.

        This was a great exercise in API design, and a chance to let other people interact with my code.
        Setting up (and teaching my friends how to use) source control for this was great practice for working in a team.
